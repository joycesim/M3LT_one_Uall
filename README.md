# M3LT_one_Uall

Two phase flow models applied to mid-ocean ridges

This suite of models accompany the paper submitted to PEPI-LAB.

To run the models:
1) Build TerraFERMA (https://terraferma.github.io/) 
2) Build and run models using  
[tfsimulationharness --run ridgemodel.shml]
This will run all six of the models presented in the paper.
